# DashPad
[An in-browser markdown renderer that allows you to save as a PDF](https://arvinpoddar.github.io/dashpad/)

DashPad uses [showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) and [Github-Markdown-CSS](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css)
to render your markdown into easy to read pages which you can then save as PDF.

In addition, DashPad saves your data automatically to your Local Storage, meaning you can close your browser and start right back where you left off.
